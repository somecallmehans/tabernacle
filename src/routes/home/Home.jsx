        …and welcome to Commander League: A unique play environment for advanced
        “Elder Dragon Highlander” a.k.a. “Commander” games of “Magic: The
        Gathering!” During each month’s league, players earn points by winning
        official games with decks that meet criteria for “achievements.” The
        more restrictive the criteria, the more points an achievement is worth.
        Basically, Commander League is a month-long tournament of deck building
        challenges roughly weighted by difficulty. Commander League offers a fun
        and challenging experience for intermediate and advanced players.
        Beginners are welcome too and will have fun! But note: players are
        empowered to use any and all strategies in pursuit of league points.

        Each league begins on the first Sunday of the month, repeats weekly, and
        concludes on the month’s final Sunday. Each week, round one begins at
        12:30pm, and round two at 2:30pm. Pod assignments for round one are
        random. In round two, pod assignments are ranked by league standings:
        players with the most points are grouped together, as are players with
        the fewest points. Each round, after 90 minutes, “sudden death” ensues.
        As the next turn begins, all players’ life totals become 1. For the rest
        of the game, players can’t gain life, damage can’t be prevented, and
        extra turns are skipped. Each player may play one more full turn, after
        which the game is a draw.

        There is inherent tension between the Commander format and leagues as
        concepts. Where Commander was invented as a strictly casual respite for
        judges after long days working Magic events, leagues of any kind are
        inherently competitive. “Commander League’s” difficult task is to add a
        degree of competitive intrigue that only an LGS can offer, without
        abandoning Commander’s core “fun and fair” ethos.

        This document is a third attempt at this challenge. While each iteration
        brings us closer to our target metagame, there will inevitably be
        imbalances and oversights. As these are discovered, please approach them
        patiently and constructively.

        league participants at all times. Bigotry in any form will not be
        tolerated, nor will cheating. Respecting fellow participants also
        requires maintaining a basic standard of cleanliness. Mimic’s Market
        sells artisanal soaps if you would like to go above and beyond in this
        regard!
